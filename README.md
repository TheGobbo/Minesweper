# Minesweper
A terminal version of the game Minesweper.


to play it on Linux download the executable and run sudo chmod +x minado && ./minado



to compile it yourself download pascal compiler fpc, ans pascal file minado.pas then run fpc minado.pas && ./minado

with the previous option you can change the height and width as well as the number of bombs on the minefield on the source code at 

"const COLUNAS; LINHAS; nbombs;"


any problems make an issue
